This directory contains a program to compare line segments formed from given point rows from any given text file.
 This checks how many pairs of line segments constructed from the text file intersect.
It also includes two test files to test classes used by the program.




Files in the directory:
  -helper.c: contains helper functions for the classes used by the program to use.
  -helper.h: the header file for helper.c.
  -point.c: the class used to create points for the line segments, includes functions
  to compare points.
  -point.h: the header file for point.c.
  -segment.c: the class used to create line segments and compare line segments,
  includes functions to compare line segments and to see if points are on line segments.
  -segment.h: the header file for segment.h.
  -list.c: a working linked list class imported from another project used to assist
  functions in this project.
  -list.h: the header file for list.c.
  -unit_tests.c: the unit test program.
  -tester.c: the whole system test program.
  -point_list.txt: a text file containing multiple lines that each consist of a pair of points
   that form line segments.
  -segment_compare.c: the program used to compare line segments from the provided text file
   or from the default text file "point_list.txt".






   Instructions:
   	-Compile unit test file "unit_tests.c" with
     "gcc --std=c99 helper.c point.c list.c segment.c -o unit_tests unit_tests.c -lcunit".

     -Run unit test file "unit_tests.c" with "./unit_tests".

     -compile whole system test file "tester.c" with
     "gcc --std=c99 helper.c point.c list.c segment.c tester.c -o tester".

     -run the whole system test file with "./tester"

     -Compile main comparison program "segment_compare.c" with
      "gcc --std=c99 helper.c point.c list.c segment.c segment_compare.c -o segment_compare".

      -Run main comparison program with "./segment_compare" followed by the path to any file
      that has points printed out in the format of the points in the default file "point_list.txt".
      Otherwise it uses the default file.
